## British Sky Broadcasting Group plc Case Study

### Summary

In 2012, British Sky Broadcasting Group plc (BSkyB) were expanding to new markets. The organisation needed a rapid solution to integrate a new market with minimal impact to their existing infrastructure. BSkyB selected Salesforce and Force.com and used Mule ESB and the Mule Salesforce connector to provide a hybrid-cloud solution that could be built and deployed rapidly thanks  to Mule’s strong  XML and integration capabilities that helped make this rapid solution possible.
Our Solution

BSkyB brought in Ricston consultants to analyse the requirement and propose a solution using best practices and kick off the project with a running start. Mule’s out-of-the-box Salesforce connector was utilised, allowing the BSkyB team to avoid having to build custom code and focus instead on configuration without the need to re-create interfaces.

Furthermore, Ricston helped overcome limitations of Salesforce when the business required to receive push notifications. Ricston’s PushTopic solution allowed Mule flow to ‘listen’ to any changes being made to the Salesforce table. Pushtopic is an extension of salesforce which notifies listeners of any changes in records.
